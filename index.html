          Guided Imagery and progressive Muscle Relaxation in Group
          Psychotherapy

            A majority of Americans experience stress in their daily lives (American
            Psychological Association,2017).Thus, an important goal of psychological
            research is to evaluate techniques that promote stress reduction and
            relaxation. Two techniques that have been associated with reduced stress
            and increased relaxation in psychotherapy contexts are guided imagery
            and progressive muscle relaxation (McGuigan & Lehrer,2007).
          </p>
        
        
        <p>
          <i>Guided imagery</i> aids individuals in connecting their internal and
          external experiences, allowing them, for example, to feel calmer
          externally because they practice thinking about calming imagery.
          <i>Progressive muscle relaxation</i> involves diaphragmatic breathing
          and tensing and releasing of 16 major muscle groups; together these
          behaviors lead individuals to a more relaxed state (Jacobson, 1938;
          Trakhtenberg, 2008). Guided imagery and progressive muscle relaxation
          are both cognitive behavioral techniques (Yalom & Leszcz, 2005) in which
          individuals focus on the relationship among thoughts, emotions, and
          behaviors(White, 2000).
        </p>
        <p>
          Group psychotherapy effectively promotes positive treatment outcomes in
          patients in a cost- effective way. Its efficacy is in part attributable
          to variables unique to the group experience of therapy as compared with
          individual psychotherapy (Bottomley, 1996;Yalom & Leszcz,2005). That is,
          the group format helps participants feel accepted and better their
          common struggles; at the same time, interactions with group members
          provide social support and models of positive behavior (Yalom & Leszcz,
          2005). Thus, it is useful to examine how stress reduction and relaxation
          can be enhanced in a group context.
        </p>
        <p>
          The purpose of this literature review is to examine the research base on
          guided imagery and progressive muscle relaxation in group psychotherapy
          contexts. I provide overviews of both guided imagery and progressive
          muscle relaxation, including theoretical foundations and historical
          context. Then I examine guided imagery and progressive muscle relaxation
          as used on their own as well as in combination as part of group
          psychotherapy (see Baider et al., 1994,for more).
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the review, I highlight themes in the research. Finally, I
          end by pointing out limitations in the existing literature and exploring
          potential directions for future research.

        <h2>Features of Guided Imagery:</h2>
        <p>
          Guided imagery involves a person visualizing a mental image and engaging
          each sense (e.g., sight, smell, touch) in the process. Guided imagery
          was first examined in a psychological context in the 1960s, when the
          behavior theorist Joseph Wolpe helped pioneer the use of relaxation
          techniques such as aversive imagery, exposure, and imaginal flooding in
          behavior therapy (Achterberg, 1985; Utay & Miller, 2006). Patients learn
          to relax their bodies in the presence of stimuli that previously
          distressed them, to the point where further exposure to the stimuli no
          longer provokes a negative response (Achterberg, 1985).
        </p>
        <p>
          Contemporary research supports the efficacy of guided imagery
          interventions for treating medical, psychiatric, and psychological
          disorders (Utay & Miller, 2006). Guided imagery is typically used to
          pursue treatment goals such as improved relaxation, sports achievement,
          and pain reduction. Guided imagery techniques are often paired with
          breathing techniques and other forms of relaxation, such as mindfulness
          (see Freebird Meditations, 2012). The evidence is sufficient to call
          guided imagery an effective, evidence-based treatment for a variety of
          stress-related psychological concerns (Utay & Miller, 2006).

          <li>Font choices on web page :
            <ul>
              <li>In this lab I made font-choices like for main headings I used a google font called Madimi One. Next, I used a font called Roboto google font for paragraphs.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Sizes of headings & main text-size : 
            <ul>
              <li>
                For main headings I used a h1 tag with font-size of 30 pixels which resembles most important tag and main heading of that paragraph and for subheading I used a tag h2 with font-size of 24 pixels which will differentiate from the h1 tag. for the entire texts in the paragraphs I used a font-size of 17 pixels for user readability.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Color choices : 
            <ul>
              <li>
                In the main headings I used white color to that green background to highlight the main heading of that respective paragraphs.
              </li>
              <li>
                For first paragraph I used a black color as text in paragraph to match with blue background color. In next paragraph I used white to the purple background by this when we hover the text looks brighter and for references I used a default blue color with zoom effects for users to easily navigate to those url's.  
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Margins or Padding Choices :
            <ul>
              <li>
                In the main headings I used a padding top & bottom with 1 pixels to adjust the heading in middle of that div. Next, In paragraphs I used a margin-left with 4 percentage to get a left-side gap and margin top & bottom with 10 pixels to get a gap on top & bottom and padding with 1 pixels in all directions to get gaps around the text in paragraphs  which looks paragraphs attractive for users.
